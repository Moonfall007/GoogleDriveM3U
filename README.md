# GoogleDriveM3U
This app allows you to stream your video files stored in Google Drive to VLC player, Smart TV, TV box, Roku, etc. directly from the cloud using an m3u playlist. There is no need to use Kodi or any kind of third-party software.

How to use it?

First of all, the app needs your video files to be stored only in one folder. This is because google drive API allows us to make only a few requests within a minute, an hour or within a day. I know it is cleaner to have your video files stored in different folders, but that limits the benefits of using this tool.

If you want to include TV logos to your playlist, it is required that these logos are stored in a different folder, using exactly the same name as the video files they match.

For instance, suppose you have a folder called "VIDEOS" and another one called "LOGOS". Both folders must share the same parent location. If you have a video file named "Back to the Future 2" stored in "VIDEOS", then the logo file that matches this video file must be named exactly the same way, ie, "Back to the Future 2" and be stored in "LOGOS".
